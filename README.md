# Testing Practice

This project was built to practice my Test-Driven Development (TDD) skills. It includes implementations and tests for various utility functions that manipulate strings and arrays. The main objective was to write tests first and then implement the functions to pass those tests.

## Note

This project was built as part of my web development journey on [The Odin Project.](https://www.theodinproject.com/)
